Plan:

Big Picture:
We make multiple load balancing algorithms and compare performances

Questions:

1. What is the control group?
shortest path algorithm
    I'm thinking that we just static allocate a shortest path from one host to another

2. How do we compare performances?
We need to compare metrics (throughput, latency, etc.) from one host to another while they are under some network resource contention (b/c thats the whole point of load balancing) -> use iperf

3. How do we standardize network resource contention?
We have some background hosts sending to each other
EX -> Our test metric will be the throughput and latency from h1 to h2
In the background, our network resource contention will be h3 talking to h4 (we can add more if needed)
Key point: there should not be enough bandwidth for one link to handle all that (they must compete for bandwidth on a single link)

4. What network topology will we use?
Fat tree -> multi path equal cost (I'm thinking k=4 cuz paper does 4)
How do we construct a fat tree -> easy, we already did it in a previous homework

Goals
4/29/25:
Set up environment and create fat tree topology

4/30/25:
Create first algorithm and set up experiment performance metrics (script)

Rest:
Do the rest -> I forgot which algorithms we were implementings
